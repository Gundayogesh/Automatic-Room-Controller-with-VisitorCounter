# Automatic-Room-Controller-with-VisitorCounter
In  today’s  world, there  is  a  continuous  need  for  automated  appliances. With  the  increase  in  the  living  standards, there  is  an  immediate  need  for  developing  circuits  that  would change  the  complexity  of  life  to  simplicity. This   Project  title “Bidirectional  Visitor  Counter  with  Automatic  Room  Light  Controller  and  Arduino  as  the  master  controller”  is designed  and  presented  in  order  to  count  the  visitors  of  an  auditorium,  hall,  offices, malls,  sports  venue, etc. The  system  counts  both  the  entering  and  exiting  visitor  of  the auditorium  or  hall  or  other  place, where  it  is  placed. Depending   upon   the    sensors interruption, the   system  identifies   the   entry  and   exit  of  the   visitor. On  the  successful implementation  of  the  system, it  displays  the  number  of  visitor  present  in  the  auditorium or  hall. This  is  an  economical  cost   reducing  system  when  implemented  in  place   where  the  visitors  have  to be counted  and  controlled. Counting  the  visitors  can  be  time consuming  so  it  helps  to  maximize  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  employees, time saving  and  sales  potential  of  an  organization, etc
